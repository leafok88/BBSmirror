LeafOK BBS is a pure web-based BBS written in PHP. It uses MySQL DB as its data storage.
LBBS is the telnet/SSH terminal server of LeafOK BBS. It referenced Firebird BBS (SMTH BBS branch) in UI design. However, most of its implementation is difference from Firebird, since it also shares the MySQL DB as data storage.

LeafOK BBSViewer was the desktop application to list / view articles of LeafOK BBS. It was written in C#. It no longer works after the major enhancement of LeafOK BBS in 2025.
LeafOK Innwebd was the experimental Innbbsd feature for LeafOK BBS. As member of cn.bbs.*, LeafOK BBS successfully achieved the cross-site news transfer between telnet-based BBS and web-based BBS. This application was developed with VC++. It was deprecated since the significant DB schema change and encoding change (GBK->UTF8) of LeafOK BBS.
