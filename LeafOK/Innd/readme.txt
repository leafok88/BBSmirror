LeafOK Innwebd was the experimental Innbbsd feature for LeafOK BBS. As member of cn.bbs.*, LeafOK BBS successfully achieved the cross-site news transfer between telnet-based BBS and web-based BBS. This application was developed with VC++. It was deprecated since the significant DB schema change and encoding change (GBK->UTF8) of LeafOK BBS.
